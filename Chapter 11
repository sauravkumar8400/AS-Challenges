b = [5, 2, 3]

EXERCISE 4
this = ["I", "am", "not", "a", "crook"]
that = ["I", "am", "not", "a", "crook"]
print("Test 1: {0}".format(this is that))   - .format checks if the variable "this" links directly to the variable "that" , which they don't. 
that = this  - linking the variable "that" to the list "this"
print("Test 2: {0}".format(this is that)) - the variables have been linked, the test would return true since the list refers to both variables
